## 🚀 Activity Recognition Data Collection Project

Welcome to our data collection project repository! This initiative is designed to capture a diverse set of 18 distinct physical activities using advanced imaging technologies. Below is a detailed overview of our data collection protocol and the activities involved.

## 🎯 Activities List

Participants perform each activity for precisely 10 seconds, resulting in a complete session duration of 3 minutes. Each participant completes the session twice, totaling no more than 15 minutes per volunteer. The activities, in the order they are performed, include:

🏃 Running in Place

🚶 Walking

🏃‍♂️ Jogging

👏 Clapping

👋 Waving with Right Hand

🤚 Waving with Left Hand

🍹 Drinking

🥁 Playing Drums

💪 Forearm Roll

🎸 Playing Guitar

🏋️‍♂️ Jump in Place

🏋️ Squats

🔄 Arms Circling

🦋 Side Butterfly

🦋 Frontal Butterfly

🚶‍♂️ Stand Abs

🥊 Boxing

🤸 Jumping Jacks

## 📸 Camera Setup

Data is meticulously captured using three synchronized camera types to ensure comprehensive coverage and data fidelity:

🎥 RGB Camera

🌡️ Thermal Camera

🤖 SNN Camera (Spiking Neural Network camera)

## 🏢 Environment

All recordings are conducted in a controlled environment equipped with both natural and artificial lighting to ensure optimal capture conditions.

## 🔄 Data Usage

The data collected will be invaluable for research and development in fields such as motion analysis, activity recognition, and beyond. We encourage contributors and researchers to utilize this dataset to explore innovative solutions and applications.
